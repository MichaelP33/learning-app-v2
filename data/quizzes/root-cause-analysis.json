      "question": "Teams jump to fixes during incidents. What stance should you require in RCAs?",
      "options": [
        "Focus on who made the mistake to ensure accountability in future",
        "Capture an evidence‑based causal chain and conditions before prescribing fixes",
        "Skip analysis when the system is restored to save time and cost",
        "Adopt a rotating blame policy so responsibility is distributed evenly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "additionalContext": "Headline: analyze causes before actions.; Why correct: a causal chain with evidence avoids shallow symptom fixes and repeats.; Why others are wrong: blame harms learning; skipping analysis loses insight; blame rotation is performative.; Cursor leverage: generate RCA template; extract timeline from logs/traces; draft causal chain prompts.; Acceptance checks: evidence links present; chain reaches systemic factors; actions trace to causes.",

      "question": "A &ldquo;5 whys&rdquo; stops at the first technical cause. Your guidance?",
      "options": [
        "Accept the first cause to close the RCA faster and move on",
        "Push deeper into conditions/policies and verify with evidence and owners",
        "Replace 5 whys with a vote on the most likely cause among reviewers",
        "Ask for longer RCAs by adding more pages without changing content"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "additionalContext": "Headline: dig to system conditions with owners.; Why correct: deeper why‑levels surface process/policy gaps and require ownership to fix.; Why others are wrong: stopping early repeats; voting is not analysis; longer docs without depth waste time.; Cursor leverage: prompt deeper whys; map causes to owners; add verification checks.; Acceptance checks: cause depth recorded; owner/actions assigned; verification plan included.",

      "question": "Actions from past RCAs were closed but issues repeat. What should RCAs include?",
      "options": [
        "Only a checkbox that the task was completed by the team",
        "Acceptance criteria and effectiveness verification after rollout",
        "A celebration note to improve morale after difficult weeks",
        "A reminder to reopen the ticket if the issue happens again"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "additionalContext": "Headline: verify that actions worked.; Why correct: acceptance criteria and post‑rollout checks confirm outcomes and prevent drift.; Why others are wrong: completion without effect is hollow; celebrations don&rsquo;t test impact; reminders are not verification.; Cursor leverage: generate acceptance criteria; add monitors/tests; schedule effectiveness reviews.; Acceptance checks: verification results linked; monitors in place; repeat rate drops.",

      "options": [
        "Keep naming individuals prominently to show transparency",
        "Use blameless language and focus on systems, signals, and safeguards",
        "Limit participation to managers only so emotions are contained",
        "Move RCAs to email threads to reduce meeting time and cost"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "additionalContext": "Headline: create safety to learn.; Why correct: blameless framing focuses on systems and encourages truthful evidence sharing.; Why others are wrong: naming blames; manager‑only limits facts; email threads lose facilitation.; Cursor leverage: provide neutral phrasing prompts; review drafts for bias; supply a blameless template.; Acceptance checks: language shifts to systems; participants contribute evidence; action quality improves.",

        "Only the final failing component since that is where the outage ended",
        "A timeline of events with handoffs and conditions across systems",
        "A list of possible causes gathered from memory and chat logs",
        "An estimate of cost only; technical details can be inferred later"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "additionalContext": "Headline: full timeline with cross‑team handoffs.; Why correct: a detailed, evidence‑backed timeline anchors causality and responsibilities.; Why others are wrong: final failure is a symptom; memories are unreliable; cost alone misses mechanism.; Cursor leverage: extract timelines from logs/traces; link PRs/incidents; produce a system map.; Acceptance checks: timeline complete; evidence links verified; teams sign off on sequence.",

      "question": "Teams debate quick fixes vs program work. What do you recommend in RCAs?",
      "options": [
        "Only quick fixes to restore service; program work is a luxury",
        "Only program‑level actions because quick fixes are band‑aids",
        "Both corrective (short‑term) and preventive (systemic) actions with owners",
        "No actions until a steering committee meets next quarter"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "additionalContext": "Headline: balance corrective and preventive work.; Why correct: short‑term reduces immediate risk while program actions prevent repeats.; Why others are wrong: quick‑only repeats; preventive‑only delays risk reduction; waiting stalls learning.; Cursor leverage: classify actions as CAPA; add owners/dates; link to roadmap.; Acceptance checks: CAPA tracked; owners accountable; repeat rate declines quarter‑over‑quarter.",

      "options": [
        "Skip RCAs for minor incidents to save time universally",

        "Publish RCAs only at quarter end to batch effort and reduce context switches",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "additionalContext": "Headline: add structure and time boxes.; Why correct: separating quick triage from deep dive with templates accelerates throughput without losing depth.; Why others are wrong: skipping loses learning; batching creates delay; senior‑only reduces capacity.; Cursor leverage: provide RCA templates; auto‑collect logs/traces/PR links; add reminders.; Acceptance checks: time to publish improves; template adherence high; stakeholders satisfied with clarity.",

      "sampleStrongResponse": "Request a linked evidence pack (logs/traces/PRs), a concise causal chain from trigger to impact, and a CAPA list with owners/dates. Define verification like 0.5% error rate improvement and page rate ≤ Y/hr. Ask Cursor to assemble the timeline, draft neutral language, and generate the action tracker with acceptance checks."

      "sampleStrongResponse": "Plan: add a blameless template and evidence pack checklist; backfill timelines for the last N incidents; flip pager policy to burn‑rate; enforce CAPA tracking with owners/dates; retire legacy formats. Safety: publish time ≤ 7 days, repeat category rate ↓ X%, stakeholder satisfaction ≥ 4/5. Comms: share the template, new policies, and where to find evidence packs. Ask Cursor to draft templates, automation, and comms."
