      "sampleStrongResponse": "Use recent range 18&ndash;24 with median near 20&ndash;21. Plan near the lower bound minus expected interrupts, e.g., 18&ndash;20 of planned work with a small buffer. Communicate as a range with confidence and assumptions, and revisit mid sprint with signals."

      "sampleStrongResponse": "Create base/best/worst scenarios with explicit buffers and quality guardrails. Define triggers like support ticket volume or dependency slippage to tighten scope, defer lower value items, or switch to a fallback plan. Keep quality bars enforced by CI and DoD."
